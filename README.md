# Fat Cat

Free mobile games use a variety of predatory monetization strategies, Loot boxes (and other elements of chance), Ads, timers (forcing us to wait real lengths of time to progress or even play.)
Fat Cat is a mobile web app allows users to set their own tolerances to these monetization strategies and find free mobile games that meet or are better than the set preferences.

# In progress

- Currently only supports mobile screen sizes, desktop support coming soon
- App result screen doesn't display all details or use app icons yet, working on a microservice to pull this data from the playstore daily
- No search function yet, looking to build the library of games up first

# Live demo
