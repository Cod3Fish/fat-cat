# Fat Cat

Free mobile games use a variety of predatory monetization strategies, Loot boxes (and other elements of chance), invasive Ads and timers (forcing us to wait real lengths of time to progress or even play.)


Fat Cat is a mobile web app that allows users to set their own tolerances to these monetization strategies and find free mobile games that meet or are better than the set preferences.

# In progress

- Currently only supports mobile screen sizes, desktop support coming soon
- App result screen doesn't display all details or use app icons yet, working on a microservice to pull this data from the playstore daily
- No search function yet, looking to build the library of games up first
- Currently only supports the Google playstore, iOS store to come soon
- Working on an aggregated score to rank games by how aggressive they are in their monetization
